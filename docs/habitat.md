Gryphons prefere eagle-like structures in social societies. A pair of Gryphons, that were hence wandering will come together and mate for life. When hunting they normally take to the air, though they have been known to hunt upon the ground in deeply wooded forests. When a male and female bond they are inseparable unless one is hunting for young while the other “baby-sits.”

Highly defensive of their meals, Gryphons normally hang dead food from tree branches to protect the meal from ground predators. When eating Gryphons keep their wings open, shading the meal from prying eyes of other predators.
   

# History

There is evidence of representations of griffins in Ancient Iranian and Ancient Egyptian art dating back to before 3000 BC.In Egypt, a griffin can be seen in a cosmetic palette from Hierakonpolis, known as the "Two Dog Palette", which is dated to ca. 3300-3100 BC. In Iran, griffins appeared on cylinder seals from Susa as early as 3000 BC. Griffin depictions appear in the Levant, Syria, and Anatolia in the Middle Bronze Age, dated at about 1950-1550 BC. Early depictions of griffins in Ancient Greek art are found in the 15th century BC frescoes in the Throne Room of the Bronze Age Palace of Knossos, as restored by Sir Arthur Evans. It continued being a favored decorative theme in Archaic and Classical Greek art.
In Central Asia, the griffin appears about a thousand years after Bronze Age Crete, in the 5th–4th centuries BC, probably originating from the Achaemenid Persian Empire. The Achaemenids considered the griffin "a protector from evil, witchcraft and secret slander". The modern generalist calls it the lion-griffin, as for example, Robin Lane Fox, in Alexander the Great, 1973:31 and notes p. 506, who remarks a lion-griffin attacking a stag in a pebble mosaic at Pella, perhaps as an emblem of the kingdom of Macedon or a personal one of Alexander's successor Antipater.


# Combat
Griffons prefer to pounce on their prey, either diving to the attack or leaping from above.
