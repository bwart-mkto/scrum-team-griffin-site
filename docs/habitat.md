The natural range of the griffin is mainly temperate hills. They are comfortable both in areas of low vegetation, where their quick speed and flight can be used to their advantage, as well as in treed areas, where they can perch high away from potential danger. Griffins are also known to use the trees in their environment to hang prey for later consumption.

Griffins are highly mobile, and the domain of a single griffin's pride can thus be vast. This, coupled with the often hidden nature of their nests, can make it difficult to pinpoint where a griffin has set up its home. When a griffin's abode is stumbled upon, they are generally found to either be large nests topping hills, or in shallow caves.
