A Griffin is a large animal, averaging 500 pounds in weight, with a body length of 8 feet. A tail adds an additional 3 feet to their length. In flight, a griffin is even more physically imposing, with a wingspan spreading 25 feet across. A griffin has the head and neck of an eagle, and the body of a lion, from which a pair of broad, golden wings extend. Occasionally, a griffin may have serpentine tail, although most subspecies of griffin have a lion tail. A griffin’s from feet are taloned, like an eagle’s, while their back legs end with two massive claw containing paws. Griffins are also relatively strong, able to carry 300 pounds as a light load, up to 900 pounds as a heavy load.

Griffins also possess exceptional eyesight, and are able to see well not only in low light conditions, but can even see in near total darkness for a distance of up to 60 feet.

Griffins breathe through the nostrils in their beak. 

# Lifecycle
Griffins are hatched from eggs. Griffins are long lived, though due to their generally solitary and deadly nature, their average lifespan is not known.

# Classification
The primary species of griffin is Griffin Griffinis. The griffin has two major subspecies, the Griffin Royalis, or Royal Griffin, which is distinguished by it's brillient silver head coloring, and Griffin Serpentinis, which is notable for its snakelike tail, in contrast to the lionesque tail of the main species.
