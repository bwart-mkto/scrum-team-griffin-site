A Griffin is a large animal, averaging 500 pounds in weight, with a body length of 8 feet. A tail adds an additional 3 feet to their length. In flight, a griffin is even more physically imposing, with a wingspan spreading 25 feet across. A griffin has the head and neck of an eagle, and the body of a lion, from which a pair of broad, golden wings extend. Occasionally, a griffin may have serpentine tail, although most subspecies of griffin have a lion tail. A griffin’s from feet are taloned, like an eagle’s, while their back legs end with two massive claw containing paws. Griffins are also relatively strong, able to carry 300 pounds as a light load, up to 900 pounds as a heavy load.

# Lifecycle
Griffins are hatched from eggs. Griffins are long lived, though due to their generally solitary and deadly nature, their average lifespan is not known.
