Griffins have been a common mascot for numerous teams, colleges, and organizations for hundreds of years. This use dates back to their extensive use in heraldry during the middle ages. Some notable examples of griffins used in this way is the Coat of arms of Crimea, the logo for Saab, the professional hockey team The Grand Rapid Griffins, and the seal used by Reed College.

Many games set in a medieval or fantasy setting feature griffins, often in the role of formidable foes. Examples include Dungeons and Dragons, Heroes of Might and Magic, and The Witcher.
