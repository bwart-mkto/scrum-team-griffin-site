Welcome to the amazing Griffin website, home to all the information about Griffons you could ever imagine. Explore each page to find out more information about this unique and mysterious creature.

The griffin, also sometimes spelled griffon, or gryphon is a fantastic creature with the body, tail, and back legs of a lion; the head and wings of an eagle; and an eagle's talons as its front feet. Griffins are considered by many to be one of the most powerful and majestic creatures in existence. Griffins tend to prefer a solitary life, and are not fans of humans, but because of the treasure that is often found in their lairs and nests, they are also commonly sought out by adventurers. This hunting has led to a relatively small griffin population, and their long term survival is uncertain.
