# Behavior

## Hunting

The animal typically gets food by lording within its opulent lair or nest, awaiting bold and foolish adventurers to find it and challenge it to battle. Upon rendering all of the adventuring party unconscious, the griffin removes their armor, weapons, and belongings to add to their horde, and consumes their corpses. In times of sparse adventuring, a griffin may take to the air, searching the land across a wide area for prey. Upon finding prey, griffins will generally attack by diving from the air and pouncing on their target. Because of a griffin's weight and sharp talons, this attack is almost always immediately fatal for the unlucky prey.

## Defenses

In response to these threats, griffins have become very capable of defending themselves and their young. Their formidable talons are capable to defeating nearly any natural foe, and should a griffin find itself outmatched, their ability to fly allows them the ability to either flee combat or to attack from a more advantageous angle. Griffins are also generally nocturnal, and their keen low light vision gives them a strong advantage in nighttime combat. Within a griffin pride, watch status is generally rotated around its members, keeping the group ever vigilant against potential threats.

## Family Life

Griffins start life in a small pride composed of their immediate family. As the griffins age, they will eventually leave this pride, taking on a largely solitary life. Eventually, two griffins will come together, and they will form a lifelong bond. These two griffins will mate and start a new pride with their offspring.

## Communication

Griffins are highly intelligent and are capable of complex vocal and physical communication between themselves, though the meaning of this communication is not yet understood. They are also capable of understanding human speech, though they can not reproduce it themselves.
