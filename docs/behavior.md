# Hunting
The animal typically gets food by lording within its opulent lair or nest, awaiting bold and foolish adventurers to find it and challenge it to battle. Upon rendering all of the adventuring party unconscious, the griffin removes their armor, weapons, and belongings to add to their horde, and consumes their corpses. In times of sparse adventuring, a griffin may take to the air, searching the land across a wide area for prey. Upon finding prey, griffins will generally attack by diving from the air and pouncing on their target. Because of a griffin's weight and sharp talons, this attack is almost always immediately fatal for the unlucky prey.

# Family Life
Griffins start life in a small pride composed of their immediate family. As the griffins age, they will eventually leave this pride, taking on a largely solitary life. Eventually, two griffins will come together, and they will form a lifelong bond. These two griffins will mate and start a new pride with their offspring.
